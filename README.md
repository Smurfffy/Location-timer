3rd Year Mobile AppsProject

Visual Studio 2015 was used to create this app. Bing maps SDK was included in the project but was not needed in the end.

This app is used to time how long it took you to get from one place to another, with the results displayed when you're finished. A map is included to see where you ended as to where you finished. An option for taking a "victory photo" with your camera is also included.
